I am dumbfounded after coming back to this several times as to why only the Stark id is picking up. When I tried using (this) instead of calling the ('img') again, it said that id was undefined... I finally got to the point of letting go because I can't afford to not move on... super frustrating though and I am stumped on what I am getting wrong...
